# resource-seq

A library for unifying resource access between repl and jar.

In the repl `clojure.java.io/resource` often helpfully returns a File object.

In a jar `clojure.java.io/reources` can unhelpfully return and URL object.

This might not be that bad, until you want to call `file-seq`.

## Usage

Clojars: `[resource-seq "0.0.1"]`

Then call `(resource-seq.core/resource-seq)`.

It returns a sequence of pairs where each first element is a string "path" that can be used for filtering and each second element is a `clojure.java.io/reader` that can be used to get the contents of the resource.
